# TODO

Maybe have a fixed set of target-independent operations, but provide the ability to implement the mapping to other IRs.

Have nodes be immutable data, and the graph is a vector of edges (inputs, outputs etc) and mutate that.
Or even no need to mutate, just create a new graph reconnecting existing nodes.
